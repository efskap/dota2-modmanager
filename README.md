dota2-modmanager
================

Manages Dota 2 mods, allowing installation/uninstallation and reordering.

Download Dota2 Mod Manager Win32.rar for a prebuilt binary and 2 sample mods of my own, demonstrating the json format for info and structure.

Simply put, create a folder in the mods directory and put the folders that'd go in dota/ (such as materials/, models/, etc) right in there. 

The manager will create an info.json that you can edit to set a description and name.
