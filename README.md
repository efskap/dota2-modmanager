dota2-modmanager
================

Manages Dota 2 mods, allowing installation/uninstallation and reordering.

Download [this rar](https://github.com/efskap/dota2-modmanager/blob/master/Dota2%20Mod%20Manager%20Win32.rar?raw=true) for a prebuilt binary and 2 sample mods of my own, demonstrating the json format for info and structure.

Simply put, create a folder in the mods directory and put the folders that'd go in dota/ (such as materials/, models/, etc) right in there. 

The manager will create an info.json that you can edit to set a description and name.
